# DeepStyle

There are two implementations to this project
1. Neural Style Transfer by Gatys et. al and multiple variations of the same.
2. Real Time Style transfer by Justin Johnsonet al and the novelties in the same

The corresponding content images, style images and the trained models are kept inside the corresponding folders along with ipynb files. Kindly take a look at all the ipynb folder for various types of implementation eg(mixed styles, rotation...etc)

### A demo folder is included which runs the implementation of both the methods.
