# DeepStyle

There are two implementations to this project
1. Neural Style Transfer by Gatys et. al and multiple variations of the same.
2. Real Time Style Transfer by Justin Johnsonet al and the novelties in the same

The corresponding content images, style images and the trained models are kept inside the corresponding folders along with ipynb files. Kindly take a look at all the ipynb folder for various types of implementation eg(mixed styles, rotation...etc)

### DEMO 
>> For 1. Neural Style Transfer : Please check Demo_Gatys.ipynb file in the Gatys directory for under 3 minutes demo. <br> Apart from this, there are multiple other .ipynb files in Gatys directory that can run the variations of Gatys. <br> <br>
>> For 2. For Real Time Style Transfer : Please check the Demo_2.ipynb in the DEMO directory for under 3 minutes demo. <br>
Apart from this, there are multiple other implementations in the Realtime Style Transfer directory that can run the variations mentioned in the report. <br> <br>
